Artist: Janis Joplin
Song: Me And Bobby Mcgee

D               D          D                D
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
         D                D        A7      A7
When I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
A7               A7        A7               A7
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
     A7              A7            D - G    D
And rode us all the way into New Orleans

  D             D             D             D
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
    D                   D7              G    G
I's playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues
G                   G                 D                D
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
A7             A7               A7   A7
We sang every song that driver knew

G                G             D                 D
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
A7                 A7                          D    D
Nothin', it ain't nothin' honey, if it ain't free
    G                G              D                 D
And feelin' good was easy, lord, oh, when he sang the blues
         A7               A7               A7  A7
You know feelin' good was good enough for me
A7               A7               D    D    E    E
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

         E         E                E          E
>From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
     E                 E          B7      B7
Yeah Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
        B7            B7              B7             B7
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
     B7         B7               E     E
Yeah Bobby baby kept me from the cold

    E              E            E                 E
One day up near Salinas, lo-ord, I let him slip away
     E                 E7                 A        A
He's lookin' for that home and I hope he finds it
         A               A              E            E
Well I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday
      B7               B7           B7   B7
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

A                A             E                 E
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
B7                   B7             E       E
Nothin', and that's all that Bobby left me
      A                A          E                     E
Well, feelin' good was easy, lo-o-ord, when he sang the blues
    B7               B7               B7  B7
And feelin' good was good enough for me
B7               B7               E         E
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee yeah
