C
It's late and she's waiting
                       F
And I know I should go home
                 C
But every time I start to leave
D7                G7
They play another song

     C
Then someone buys another round
                        F
And wherever drinks are free
                      C
What's Made Milwaukee Famous
           G7          C
Has made a fool out of me

G7
Baby's begged me not to go
D7              G7
So many times before

She said love and happiness
           D7                         G7
Just can't live behind those swinging doors

          C
Now she's gone and I'm to blame
                   F
Too late I finally see
                      C
What's Made Milwaukee Famous
           G7           C
Has made a loser out of me
