The Winner Takes It All

		D
I don't wanna talk
			A
About the things we've gone through
		Em
Though it's hurting me
		A
Now it's history
(D	A	Em	A)
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

		D
The winner takes it all
		Bm7
The loser standing small
		Em
Beside the victory
		A
That's her destiny


(D	A	Em	A)
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
(D	A	Em	A)
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

(D	Bm7	Em	A)
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
(D	Bm7	Em	A)
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain.


(D	A	Em	A)
But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
(D	A	Em	A)
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say
Rules must be obeyed

(D	A	Em	A)
The judges will decide
The likes of me abide

Spectators of the show
Always staying low
(D	Bm7	Em	A)
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all


(D	A	Em	A)
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
(D	A	Em	A)
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence

But you see
(D	A	Em	A)
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all...
