D               A7
Way out in Reno Neva-da
                         D
Where romance blooms and fades
                     G
A great Philadelphia lawyer
       A7                    D
Was in love with a Hollywood maid

                      A7
Come love and we will wander
                         D
Out where the lights are bright
                                 G
I'll win you a divorce from your husband
       A7              D
And we can get married tonight

                          A7
Now Bill was a gun-toting cowboy
                               D
Ten notches were carved on his gun
                    G
All the boys around Reno
     A7                 D
Left wild Bill's maiden alone

                      A7
One night when he was returning
                             D
From riding the range in the cold
                            G
He dreamed of his Hollywood sweetheart
    A7                     D
Her love was as lasting as gold

                    A7
As he drew near her window
                       D
A shadow he saw on the shade
                           G
Was the great Philadelphia lawyer
       A7                    D
Making love to his Hollywood maid

                              A7
The night was as still as the desert
                    D
The moon was bright overhead
                            G
Bill listened a while to the lawyer
         A7                      D
He could hear every word that he said

                             A7
Your hands are so pretty and lovely
                      D
Your form so rare and divine
                       G
Come go with me to the city
    A7                     D
And leave this wild cowboy behind

                A7
Now back in old Pennsylvania
                      D
Among those beautiful pines
                              G
There's one less Philadelphia lawyer
   A7               D
In old Philadelphia tonight
