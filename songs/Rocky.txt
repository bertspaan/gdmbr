Rocky

D              A                  D                A
Alone until my eighteenth year we met four springs ago
D               A             D                  D
She was shy and had a fear of things she did not know
D               A             D           A
But we got it on together in such a super way
D                    A                  D                A
We held each other close at night and traded dreams each day

Chorus
D        G                                    D
She said Rocky I've never been in love before don't know if I can do it
A                                     D
But if you let me lean on you take my hand I might get through it through it
G                              D
I said baby oh sweet baby it's love that sets us free
    A                                      G                 D
And God knows if the world should end your love is safe with me

2nd verse
D                    A                   D               A
We found an old grey house and you would not believe the way
D                     A              D              A
We worked at night to fix it up took classes in the day
D                  A            D               A
Painting walls and sipping wine sleeping on the floor
D                  A                      D                  A
With so much love with just too soon we found there'd be one more

2nd chorus
A            G                                   D
And she said Rocky I've never had a baby before, don't know if I can do it
A                              D
But if you let me lean on you, take my hand I might get through it, through it
G                               D
I said baby, oh sweet baby it's love that sets us free,
    A                                     G                 D
and God knows if the word should end your love is safe with me.

3rd verse
D               A             D                 A
We had lots of problems then but we had lots of fun
D                  A              D               A
Like the birthday party when our baby girl turned one
D                A         D                   A
I was proud and satisfied life had so much to give
D                  A                D                    A
Till the day they told me back she didn't have long to live
A        G                               D
She said Rocky I never had to die before don't know if I can do it
4th verse
(bridge up)
E                 B          E              B
Now it's back to two again my little girl and I
E                B                       E                     B
Who looks so much like her sweet mother sometimes that makes me cry
E                 B             E              B
I sleep alone at nights again I walk alone each day
E                      B                 E                      B
And sometimes when I'm about to give in I hear her sweet voice say to me

3rd chorus
A                                         E
Rocky you know you've been alone before, you know that you can do it
B                                       E
But if you'd like to lean on me, take my hand I'll help you through it, through it.
A                               E
I said baby, oh sweet baby it's love that sets us free
    B                                      A                 E
And God knows if the world should end, your love is safe with me
         A
She said Rocky you know you've been alone before... fade
