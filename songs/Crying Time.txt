Crying Time

CHORUS:
D                                        A
Oh, it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me.
A7                                    D
I can see that far away look, in your eyes.
D7                                 G
I can tell by the way you hold me, darling.
        D                A                D
That it won't be long, before it's crying time.

D                                                A
Now, they say that absence, makes the heart grow fonder.
A7                                        D
And that tears are only rain to make love grow.
D7                                         G
Well, my love for you could never grow, no stronger.
     D             A             D
If I lived to be a hundred years old.

CHORUS:
D                                        A
Oh, it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me.
A7                                    D
I can see that far away look, in your eyes.
D7                                 G
I can tell by the way you hold me, darling.
        D                A                D
That it won't be long, before it's crying time.

D                                               A
Now, you say you've found someone that you love better.
A7                                               D
Well, that's the way it's happened, every time before.
D7                                G
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow,
       D                    A                D
crying time will start when you walk out the door.

CHORUS:
D                                        A
Oh, it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me.
A7                                    D
I can see that far away look, in your eyes.
D7                                 G
I can tell by the way you hold me, darling.
        D                A                D
That it won't be long, before it's crying time.
