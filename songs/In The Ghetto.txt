In The Ghetto

       D       D/G
As the snow flies
	F#m
On a cold and grey chicago mornin'
  G		   A
A poor little baby child is born
	D	D/G
In the ghetto

        D          D/G
And his mama cries
           F#m
'cause if there's one thing that she don't need
      G             A
It's another hungry mouth to feed
        D
In the ghetto

		  A
People don't you understand
		  G	  D
The child needs a helping hand
   G		       A		     D
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
		A
Take a look at you and me,
	   G	    D
Are we too blind to see,
      G	      F#m       		G              A
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way


Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

A
Then one night in desperation
G	            D
A young man breaks away
   G		F#m
He buys a gun, steals a car,
G			A
Tries to run, but he don't get far

And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto

And as her young man dies,

On a cold and grey chicago mornin',
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto

And his mama cries

On a cold and grey chicago mornin',
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto
On a cold and grey chicago mornin',
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto
On a cold and grey chicago mornin',
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto
