If You Wanna Be Happy For The Rest Of Your Life

Chorus:
                 G                          A
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
              F#m                 Bm
Never make a pretty woman your wife
             G                 A
So from my personal point of view
             A               D
Get an ugly girl to marry you

If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you


Verse:
D                            Bm
A pretty woman makes a man look small
   A                      D
And very often causes his downfall
As soon as he married her
Then she starts doin' the things that will break his heart

But if you make an ugly woman your wife
You'll be happy for the rest of your life
An ugly woman cooks your meals on time
An she'll always treat you kind

Chorus:
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you

Verse:
Don't let your friends say you have no taste
Go ahead and marry her anyway
Though her face is ugly and her eyes don't match
Take it from me, she's a better catch


Chrous:
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life...
