Starry Starry
D                        Em
night paint your pallete blue and grey
              G                A7                               D
Look out on a summers day with eyes tha know the darkness in my soul
                                      Em
Shadows on hills sketch the tress and daffodils
                         G               A7                        D
Catch the breeze and the winter chill In colors on the snowy linen land

chorus
G   D                  Em     A7                    D           Bm
        And now I understand      what you tried to say to me
                         Em7     A7                           Bm
How you suffered for you sanity     How you tried to set them free
                              E7          Em7   A7                   D
They would not listen the did not know how   perhaps they 'll listen now


Starry starry nite flamings flowr's that brightly blaze
Swirling coulds in violet haze reflect in VIncents eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue,morning fields of amber graing
Weatherd faces lined inpain Are soothed beneath the artists loving hand

chorus
          D                     Em7       A7                      D
{listen now}  For the could not love you  but still your love was true
Bm              Em7                            Gm6
    And when no hope was left in sight on that starry starry nite
    D                C7           B7       Em7
You took you life as lovers often do But I could of told you Vinvent
     G                                A7           D
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you

Starry starry nite portraits hung in empty halls
frameless heads on nameless walls with i's that watch the world and cant forget
Like
the strangers that youve met,the ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn the bloody rose Lire crushed and broken on the virgin snow
chorous

G   D                  Em     A7                    D           Bm
        And now I understand      what you tried to say to me
                         Em7     A7                           Bm
How you suffered for you sanity     How you tried to set them free
                                  E7               Em7   A7
They would not listen theyre not  listening still     perhaps they never will
