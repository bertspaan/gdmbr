Intro:D Bm (Repeat)
                  D Bm (Repeat)
Love is all about chemistry
Isn't something you go off to school to learn
It isn't math or ancient history
It's the kind of thing that comes down to simple terms

               Em
It's not about you
               A
It's not about me

                 D Bm (Repeat)
Love is all about we
Yes, it's all about we

                         D Bm (Repeat)
Want to take you to that great unknown
Show you to a place you've never been
Down a road where only lovers go
But before we leave, I want to repeat again
               Em
It's not about you
                   A
And it's not about me
                  D Bm (Repeat)
Love is all about we
All about we

                      A     G    D
With a string you can tie a knot
                   A            G      D
But you gotta have somethin' to tie it to
                     A        G     D
Otherwise all you've got is a knot
                   Em
When it ties me to you,
                   A
It's a whole other thing
                        D Bm (Repeat)
Cause Love is all about we
Love is all about we

D Bm (Repeat)
Love is not about young or old
Touches everybody in a special way
It's a blanket when the nights are cold
It can even keep you dry on a rainy day
                   Em
And it's not about you
               A
It's not about me
                  D Bm (Repeat)
Love is all about we
Yes, it's all about we


                      A     G    D
With a string you can tie a knot
                   A            G      D
But you gotta have somethin' to tie it to
                     A        G     D
Otherwise all you've got is a knot
                   Em
When it ties me to you
                   A
It's a whole other thing
                        D Bm (Repeat)
Cause Love is all about we
Yes it's all about we

                  Em
No, its not about you
               A
It's not about me

                  D Bm (Repeat)
Love is all about we
Yes it's all about we
Say it's all about we
You and me
Say it's all about we
You and me
We ah-we ah-we ah-we ah-we
Love is all about we...
