     |D        |       |             |
In a bar in To-ledo ac-ross from the depot on a
|             |            |A7    |
bar stool she took off her ring
  |Em             |         |A7
I thought i'd get closer so I walked on over I
|Em          |A7       |D      |
sat down and asked her name
|        |              |           |
When the drinks finally hit her she said I'm no
|             |            |D7      |G      |
quitter but I finally quit livin on dreams
    |A7        |            |         |
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after I'm
|          |        |          |D
after what-ever the other life brings

|D     |        |           |         |
In the mirror I saw him and I closely watched him I
|              |             |A7      |
thought how he looked out of place
|       |Em          |       |A7              |
He came to the woman who sat there be-side me he
|Em           |A7         |D       |
had a strange look on his face
    |              |            |
The big hands were calloused he looked like a
|              |        |D7           |G      |
mountain for a minute I thought I was dead
    |A7        |           |
But he started shaking his big heart was
|           |             |         |D
breaking he turned to the woman and said

|D           |            |           |G
You picked a fine time to leave me Lu-cille
     |           |              |           |D     |
with four hungry children and a crop in the field
|G            |         |                  |
I've had some bad times lived through some sad times but
|              |             |D
this time your hurting won't heal
|            |A7          |           |D      |
you picked a fine time to leave me Lu-cille.

|D       |         |          |         |
After he left us I ordered more whisky I thought how she'd
|             |A7     |
made him look small
|        |Em           |             |A7       |
From the lights of the bar room to a rented ho-tel room we
|Em            |A7        |D      |
walked without talking at all
|         |          |             |
She was a beauty but when she came to me she

|                 |D7         |G      |
must have thought I'd lost my mind
|A7        |                 |          |
I could'nt hold her 'cos the words that told her kept
|           |          |D
coming back time after time

|D           |            |           |G
You picked a fine time to leave me Lu-cille

|G            |         |                  |

|              |             |D
